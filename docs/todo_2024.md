fixes:

- [ ] make jump more consistent - frame rate independent
- [ ] alt + enter should reduce window size - if it doesn't  fit screen bounds
- [ ] make rotate with mouse perfect
    - [ ] make rotate physics body towards camera rotation
    - [ ] make camera rotation free flow, but position should be fixed onto body


todo:

- [ ] generate c files for our projects includes
    - will reduce total lines needed by alot
    - we should also check if already exist
- [ ] save/load settings for window size / window maximized state
- [ ] save/load debug settings like disable_mouse_lock

improve visuals:

- [ ] add AO on models
- [ ] add outline to models


cool mechanics:

- [ ] portals, bring them back

# remember you can do #dataType to make it a string (use hash at start) to debug in macros

- [ ] for simple make, make a platform folder (linux or windows)
- [ ] make build folders per platform / build tags (for web and on window builds)
- [ ] use a check for library and simply warn user here to make platform-sdk
- [ ] integrate google services, for achievements, etc
- [ ] automate google play store uploads
- [ ] note processor in build directory [x64 / x86 / Arm] - linux-x86_64, windows-x86_64, linux_arm64

// todo editor:
// todo: edit prefab for component and hierarchy uis, so i can add appropriate ui links to the entities and components there and tags
// todo: fix background not regenerating due to system order issues, just make another state that happens after dirty for a entire frame, actually use same byte, just flag the bit in it to track it

// todo: grab these (prefab_app, etc) from reference list of zoxel prefabs
// todo: put a AutoResizeZextX tag on these, so it resizes the background of a text that updates
// todo: put this in element_resize_system like element_position_system

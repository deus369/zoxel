Current Todo

Now:
- [ ] use valgrind to catch crashes more
    - it appears to be coming from characters
    - probably when they change chunks - check that code again!
    - disable chunk setting for npcs for now
- [ ] refactor terminal arguments to add terminal commandds in each sub module
    - so we can test with valgrind easier, we need to reduce realm data spawning
    - [ ] add disable items commands
    - [ ] add disable skills commands
- [ ] optimize streaming chunks
    - set timing per new chunk to 3 seconds to make easier to debug
    - profile different systems
    - set scale double and reduce division, so we effectively get 16x16x16 chunks
        - 32 is a bit too demanding
- [ ] Remove players2 module - was a quick hack
    - where to put stuff?

Next
- [ ] refactor characters so we can add skills / stats onto their prefabs in the sub modules
- [ ] Fix falling through map
    - test with debug key for pushing down
    - do a hack / check system for inside voxel
    - if inside solid voxel, just move to nearest fitting position (make sure all corners of bounding box fits) - does_fit_in_terrain function using bounding box and terrain as inputs - just keep checking for nearest place

Game Flow / UI
- [ ] New Game UI
- [ ] Load Game UI - show time played and level of player

Terrain
- [ ] spawn grass model dynamically
- [ ] spawn multiple grass voxels and instance them seperately
    - did i do this with flowers already??
- [ ] Add Voxel Lighting
- [ ] Build Terrain LOD based on resolution
    - atm we just build highest resolution for all chunks
- [ ] Spawn structures across chunks
    - [ ] Spawn Trees
    - [ ] Spawn Towns
- [ ] Make skybox follow players
    - [ ] can we make some things render per camera only
- [ ] fix colors being same per seed

Items
- [ ] Fix block drop textures

Characters
- [ ] Add AO on vox models
- [ ] Add Outlines on Vox Models
- [ ] Connect two voxes together
- [ ] generate head and chest mesh for player character
- [ ] Instancing on NPCs
- [ ] character text file for
    - mr penguin
    - slimes
    - flying vox ? make one with wings

Low priority
- [ ] Investigate - sometimes it crashes i think
- [ ] fix lag on game start - realm gen probably
- [ ] frame rate timeline is broken - press "n"
- [ ] remove uis for free camera
    - [ ] also put a frame around ui so we know we are in free camera mode
- [ ] Dynamically Include all modules in src - instead of manually listing includes / imports
    - for zengine, we just fetch all systems
    - each module will have requirements
    - we can use to determine the order of importing automatically
- [ ] improve log functions to use a tag 'io' or 'voxels' or something
    - this will make it less typed, easier to add new log types
- [ ] Debug Visually Chunk LOD levels

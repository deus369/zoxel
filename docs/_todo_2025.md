Current Todo

Now
- [ ] Fix Streaming Chunks
    - set scale double and reduce division, so we effectively get 16x16x16 chunks
        - 32 is a bit too demanding
    - set timing per new chunk to 3 seconds to make easier to debug
    - profile different systems
- [ ] Investigate - sometimes it crashes i think
- [ ] Fix falling through map
- [ ] Remove players2 module - was a quick hack
    - where to put stuff?
- [ ] Make skybox follow players
    - [ ] can we make some things render per camera only

Later
- [ ] fix lag on game start - realm gen probably
- [ ] frame rate timeline is broken - press "n"
- [ ] remove uis for free camera
    - [ ] also put a frame around ui so we know we are in free camera mode
- [ ] Connect two voxes together
- [ ] New Game UI
- [ ] Add Outlines on Vox Models
- [ ] Add AO on vox models
- [ ] Add Voxel Lighting
- [ ] Build Terrain LOD based on resolution
    - atm we just build highest resolution for all chunks
- [ ] add log function per module when debugging
- [ ] Spawn structures across chunks
    - [ ] Spawn Trees
    - [ ] Spawn Towns
- [ ] Instancing on NPCs
- [ ] Dynamically Include all modules in src - instead of manually listing includes / imports
    - for zengine, we just fetch all systems
    - each module will have requirements
    - we can use to determine the order of importing automatically
- [ ] find a way to test streaming with valgrind
    - set distance small
    - remove modules for tests
- [ ] improve log functions to use a tag 'io' or 'voxels' or something
    - this will make it less typed, easier to add new log types
- [ ] Debug Visually Chunk LOD levels

Current Todo

Now
- [ ] put combat logs behind a log util function
- [ ] make zox_set_entity_names an arg i can put in
- [ ] Manabar + Energybars (player ui)
- [ ] support multiple fonts, make title ui pixel font (not miracode)
- [ ] damage popups when hit npc
- [ ] fix 2D lines - grid is gone on zixel prototype
- [ ] overlay icon for skill when its in use (aura)
    - [ ] when mouse pickup - it should show there too
- [ ] New Game UI
- [ ] spawn grass model dynamically
    - [ ] make grass same color as grass blocks
    - make grass use custom vox model instead of static one it currently uses
    - make sure adding voxels is simple to do in a file
- [ ] add more grass models so we can vary the grass
    - [ ] multiple models per voxel placement
    - [ ] using a second vbo grouping like flowers
- [ ] refactor characters so we can add skills / stats onto their prefabs in the sub modules
- [ ] Fix falling through grounds
    - [ ] make a new debug character system so you can see when they fall (big vertical line beams from their position to 128 height)
- [ ] villager npcs will spawn with bones
- [ ] npcs should spawn in lowest resolution until attacked (enemy npc type)
- [ ] NPC batch rendering
- [ ] Remove players2 module - was a quick hack
    - where to put stuff?
- [ ] compass - gizmo - so i can see north / west

Fixes
- [ ] go to corner of chunk and move around, you will get a crash
- [ ] put a death timer on terrain chunks - to handle fast movement between chunks
    - if moving around chunk corners it will reset timer on their death
    - 12 seconds death timer

Optimize
- [ ] seperate raycasting from raycast gizmos
- [ ] fix the in game profiler
- [ ] add per system ingame profiler
- [ ] Optimize realm spawning - it lags a bit on start game
- [ ] optimize streaming chunks
    - set timing per new chunk to 3 seconds to make easier to debug
    - profile different systems
    - set scale double and reduce division, so we effectively get 16x16x16 chunks
        - 32 is a bit too demanding
- [ ] add a stats overlay to show all the entities (main ones)
    - ui elements
    - characters
    - players
    - terrain chunks
    - terrains
    - clouds
    - particles
    - voxels (minivox, damaged blocks, dungeon blocks, etc)

Later
- [ ] update npcs voxels to show 'corruption' - colored blocks
    - remember to only update if voxel updated is visible (on outside)
    - can move from instance rendered npc to individual when it is modified
- [ ] load a terrain in background with graybox on title screen
- [ ] import shaders as proper shader files, make more robust
- [ ] link item pickups to chunks too - to remove on map end
- [ ] Fix falling through map
    - test with debug key for pushing down
    - do a hack / check system for inside voxel
    - if inside solid voxel, just move to nearest fitting position (make sure all corners of bounding box fits) - does_fit_in_terrain function using bounding box and terrain as inputs - just keep checking for nearest place
- [ ] add names again to entities, fucking hard to find out whats going on with logging
- [ ] audio options
    - [ ] mute terminal option
    - [ ] save load mute option
    - [ ] toggle ui for muting in options
    - [ ] tabs in options

Game Flow / UI
- [ ] Load Game UI - show time played and level of player

Terrain
- [ ] spawn multiple grass voxels and instance them seperately
    - did i do this with flowers already??
- [ ] Add Voxel Lighting
- [ ] Build Terrain LOD based on resolution
    - atm we just build highest resolution for all chunks
- [ ] Spawn structures across chunks
    - [ ] Spawn Trees
    - [ ] Spawn Towns
- [ ] Make skybox follow players
    - [ ] can we make some things render per camera only
- [ ] fix colors being same per seed

Items
- [ ] Fix block drop textures

Characters
- [ ] Add AO on vox models
- [ ] Add Outlines on Vox Models
- [ ] Connect two voxes together
- [ ] generate head and chest mesh for player character
- [ ] Instancing on NPCs
- [ ] character text file for
    - mr penguin
    - slimes
    - flying vox ? make one with wings

Low priority
- [ ] fix lag on game start - realm gen probably
- [ ] frame rate timeline is broken - press "n"
- [ ] remove uis for free camera
    - [ ] also put a frame around ui so we know we are in free camera mode
- [ ] Dynamically Include all modules in src - instead of manually listing includes / imports
    - for zengine, we just fetch all systems
    - each module will have requirements
    - we can use to determine the order of importing automatically
- [ ] improve log functions to use a tag 'io' or 'voxels' or something
    - this will make it less typed, easier to add new log types
- [ ] Debug Visually Chunk LOD levels
- [ ] add disable items commands
- [ ] add disable skills commands

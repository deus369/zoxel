Current
- [ ] Fix minimize + restore bug, isn't restoring everything atm on linux

Later
- [ ] Dynamically Include all modules in src - instead of manually listing includes / imports
    - for zengine, we just fetch all systems
    - each module will have requirements
    - we can use to determine the order of importing automatically
- [ ] find a way to test streaming with valgrind
    - set distance small
    - remove modules for tests

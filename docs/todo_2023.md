# now todo #

- [ ] fix fullscreening not resizing canvas
- [ ] Make a second canvas for debug uis

- [ ] reworking streaming chunks
- [ ] can add timers to spawning off chunks so its past x seconds from when they're born (bornTime)

- [ ] convert a directory of music files, not just one
- [-] Scenes data! main menu and game atm
- [ ] generate grass instead of using preset one
- [ ] support for multiple grass models (variations)
- [ ] start screen
- [ ] influence sphere for bones
- [ ] debug bone influence spheres
- [ ] support for bigger vox meshes
    - [ ] needs multiple chunks
    - [ ] pass in bones to each child chunk
- [ ] join head and body as single vox (add head onto body, use this)
    - [ ] join_vox(body_vox, head_vox, 0, 22, -3) last is offset
    - [ ] for hips, we just join it again
- [ ] fix item voxel textures - world items
- [ ] fix vox item textures - block voxes

- [ ] refactor transform to use flecs relationships EcsChildOf
    - [ ] do this for bones for now
    - [ ] test initially for main functions


- make process command to process all raw files into resources
    - then pushes to any build targets

// todo: add note timings, and check them all when playing
//      ^ add two sounds together
// todo: multiple musics, and playlists (musicLinks)
// todo: each music note - will check music start time - get current time, to know when to spawn sound - makes it more dynamic

## debug

- [ ] fps frame rate viewer - line ui for last x (3) seconds

// todo: fix window headers, make body a child, atm clicking header over another window breaks, because it restacks the window under the header ui
// todo: remember local layers for each element under window, and add those, instead of incrementally just adding like I do atm (this can be done later, not issue for now)

// done:
//      - When spawning window, set window layer
//      - count the highest children count so we can dynamically set layers_per_window
//      - also remember WindowLayer's set, so we can keep stack organized and just move window up
//      - handles new windows properly
//      - handle removal of windows in stack on update
## ui

    - [ ] set position of labels to left of the ui in the list, left anchoring
        - [ ] tab out based on a 'tab' character
    - [ ] add float3, float4, entity, doubles (deadtime) and anything else i can too editor values
    - [ ] don't delete old children just reuse for list updates

## io
- [ ] load generic textures, linking to realm
    - [ ] load textures dynamically from textures folder in resources
    - [ ] draw a texture inside a test element - link it there
- [ ] save file in multithread
- [ ] push save file to steam cloud when saving

## game

    - [ ] meta data have name, description, TextureLink
    - [ ] test deletion to make sure only meta data deletes texture

- [ ] link user skill to a texture
- [ ] link actionbar ui to character
- [ ] spawn player character user action entities
- [ ] spawn player character user skill entities


## web build

- [ ] Fix Pipeline, 'make push-web' should push to a zox-web git repo the latest build
    - test with zoxel-web

## devops

- [ ] automate beta builds every saturday it should perform all platforms
- [ ] test results can be displayed in a simple text file
- [ ] push builds to git repo every week on a saturday

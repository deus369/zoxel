# development pipelines
- I need low mental tasks to combine with my high intensity ones
    - this means tools for content creation so I can use established repetition
    - these tasks require less processing mentally so I can produce game content
    - procedural generation is good but requires more mental prowess compared to traditional pipelines and routines gamedevs use

- we should spawn prefabs in a seperate step after imports - this is because prefabs is like data settings instead of initialization of code

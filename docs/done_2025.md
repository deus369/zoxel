2025 Done List

Fixes
- [x] fix item textures
- [x] fix character raycasting
- [-] fix flecs profiler [cannot fix as flecs issues]
- [-] terrain should have a list of characters too, if npc falls out of chunks put there
- why does it destroy characters / chunk at start??
- [x] test linking again characters t to chunks
- [x] test spawn a entity with EntityLinks and destroy - toggle function
- [x] Fix Crashes
    - it appears to be coming from characters
    - probably when they change chunks - check that code again!
    - disable chunk setting for npcs for now

Refactoring
- [x] refactor terminal arguments to add terminal commandds in each sub module
    - so we can test with valgrind easier, we need to reduce realm data spawning

Unsorted
- [x] Build Folder per Game Names
- [x] Fix minimize + restore bug, isn't restoring everything atm on linux
- [x] move all modules into src - flat hierarchy
- [x] log functions and defines for debugging different parts of code
    - this gives me ability to turn log codes on and off with defines
- [x] find a way to test streaming with valgrind
    - set distance small
    - remove modules for tests
    - remove npcs for this - npcs can be a seperate test without terrain
- [x] add log function per module when debugging
- [x] Fix Streaming Chunks

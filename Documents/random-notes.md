Flecs Documentation needs:
   An injection example for X x Y data reltionships, like many AIs linked to many Characters
   Disposing of allocated data in components examples
   Multithreading examples / section
   Bulk Spawning in threads (and example codes)
   A Simple Render system example, perhaps in a flecs.graphics module? This needs more thoughts
   Web Build guide with emcc (this isn't entirely needed but a nice to have)

### Well-Being in the New Year

I am happy with the progress that I have made so far on my voxel RPG development. However, I have decided to take a step back and prioritize reducing stress in 2023. This means that I will be working on the game a bit less and focusing on other commitments, such as art, music, and playing games. It's important for me to take care of myself and make sure that I am in a good place both mentally and physically. While I am passionate about game development, it's important for me to find a balance and make sure that I am taking care of myself as well.

### Code Structure

Our codebase is organized into modules, with the game engine serving as the main module. Below the game engine, we have five main modules: core, inner_core, outer_core, gameplay, and space. Each main module has its own set of sub modules, with the core module containing sub modules such as generic, maths, timing, transforms, networking, apps, inputs, rendering, and cameras. Within each module, we have systems, components, prefabs, and utility functions to support the various features and functionality of the game. This modular approach helps to keep the code organized and easy to maintain.

### GPL License

The GPL (GNU General Public License) is a popular open-source license that allows users to modify and distribute software as long as they make the source code freely available. This encourages collaboration and innovation within the software community. The GPL also requires that any modifications or derivatives of the licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL, ensuring that the software remains open and freely available to others in the future.

### A Bright Future Ahead

Zoxel is a voxel-based RPG that has been in development for over a decade. The game was first made in Java in 2009, and has since been remade using different game engines such as Unity and Unreal. The most recent iteration of the game added Unity's Entity Component System (ECS), which improved its performance and scalability.

Now, the game is being remade again, this time using a custom game engine that the developer has written themselves. This will allow the game to be tailored to the developer's specific needs and requirements, resulting in a more unique and innovative gameplay experience for players.

Players can expect a vast, open-world environment to explore, as well as procedurally generated quests and enemies. The game's charming voxel-based graphics and character customization options will also add to the experience.

Overall, Zoxel is a game that has been developed with passion and dedication over many years, and players can look forward to a unique and engaging gameplay experience.
